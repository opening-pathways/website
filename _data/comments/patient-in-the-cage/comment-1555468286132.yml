message: "This is so strong, such strong thinking. It's too late at night to list all the yesses.... as I tweeted, \"Why are you studying me yet not freaking LISTENING TO ME?\" It captures all the issues of paternalism (well-meaning or snotty), agency (the negative side - \"Who cares what you think?? We are the professors!\"), and other dialectic things I heard in the revolutionary college years of the 60s but didn't memorize ... blacks rebelling against being studied by privileged whites, women rebelling against being studied by privileged men, gays rebelling against being studied by everyone privileged. It's at the root of my saying at the start of my TED Talk, \"You heard it this morning - patients saying >>>I<<< will define the terms of my disease.\"\r\n\r\nThis is seriously major patient autonomy stuff.  Keep going."

  Thanks Dana for this post. One of the interesting and important things you
  highlight is that conflicts typically begin at the first moment of
  conceptualizing the research project. Researchers are typically thinking in
  the context of trends and issues within their discipline; patients (and other
  participant-researchers) are typically have questions motivated by their
  personal goals and experiences. So ABC and XYZ aren't just competing research
  priorities within the same discipline or group of disciplines, but expressions
  of profoundly different orientations toward discovery. The challenge starts
  there, in identifying areas of overlap (which of course do exist) between the
  concerns of different domains. I think that's part of what you and Eric are
  developing, not just a set of overlapping research questions but also some
  generalizable approaches to developing these research questions.

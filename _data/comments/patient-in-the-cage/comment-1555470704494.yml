  Trenchant analysis as usual, Dana. Given that the term “research subject” does
  tend to imply a passive status, it would likely go a great deal of good to
  re-name study participants as “collaborator participants” or “partner
  participants” so that the subjective meaning begins to shift the researchers’
  thinking.

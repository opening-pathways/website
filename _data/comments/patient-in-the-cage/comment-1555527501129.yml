  Dana, thank you for this post and for your continued leadership! Speaking from
  my own experiences of trying to establish patient-driven research as a field
  within academia, I am well aware of how extremely hard it is... Keep up the
  good work and I hope the work you and Eric do together soon gets followers,
  the world needs it!

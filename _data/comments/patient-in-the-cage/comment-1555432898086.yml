  Lorraine, thanks for this comment and great example! I hadn't heard that
  phrase of "helicopter research" before - but it makes a lot of sense to me.
  (We've done a similar thing with the [OpenAPS Data
  Commons](https://openaps.org/data-commons/) as well to facilitate research
  partnerships & focus on otherwise overlooked topics.) Looking forward to
  sharing your example in the future as well!

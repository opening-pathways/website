  Dana--this pretty much nails why we launched the MyLymeData patient registry. 
  The traditional approach to research (Researcher-centric research) often
  leaves patients delegitimized. This is sometimes called helicopter
  research--where a team of experts sweeps in concocts a study--and leaves the
  community with the remains.  Research needs to be done in partnership period.
  That is our model.  Our experience though is that that partnership requires
  that patients take the lead.

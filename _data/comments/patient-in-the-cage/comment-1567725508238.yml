  Dana - thanks so much for writing about this experience.  It reminds me of
  seeing a doctor as a child; there was a resident there, and they were
  discussing me as if I weren't sitting right there.  I had a question, which I
  asked, and from the senior doctor's reaction, you would have thought I was a
  dog who could suddenly talk, but this was not a good thing, because how dare I
  talk?!  Clinicians are trained more and more now to be partners, not gods, but
  I don't think researchers get the same training.
